# Delivery Me

## Important Note Before Running

The given endpoint is not working properly. Therefore, I have used npoint.io to create a JSON bin. 

If the configured JSON bin endpoint is not working, it's probably due to expiration. Please follow the steps below to set up a working endpoint for testing.

## Steps to Create a JSON Bin and Update Endpoint

1. **Create a JSON Bin**:
   - Visit [npoint.io](https://www.npoint.io/).
   - Create a new JSON bin by following the instructions on the website.
   - You can find dummy data in `my_deliveries.fixture.json` inside `Test Target`. Paste the dummy data into the JSON bin to simulate the response. 
   - Save the JSON bin and copy the provided endpoint URL.

2. **Update the Endpoint Path**:
   - Open the `DeliveriesRequest` file in project.
   - Update the endpoint path with the URL of the JSON bin you created.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the project with functional data and endpoints.

## Repository Pattern for Data Management
I need to manage data from two different sources: a remote API and a local cache using Core Data. The key challenge here is to optimize data retrieval to ensure the app performs efficiently and provides a smooth user experience.

To handle this, Iâ€™ve implemented the repository pattern, which plays a crucial role in managing the app's data flow.

The repository provides a single point of access to the data, encapsulating the logic for determining whether to load data from the cache or fetch it from the remote source.

Practical Flow in the App
- **Cache First**: When a request for data is made, the repository first checks the cache (Core Data) to see if the required data is already available and sufficient.
- **Remote Fetch**: If the cache doesn't have enough data, the repository fetches the necessary data from the remote API.
- **Update Cache**: After fetching from the remote source, the repository saves this data to the cache (Core Data).
